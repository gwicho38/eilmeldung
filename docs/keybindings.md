## Reading Articles

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `o` | Open article in browser, mark as read, and jump to next unread |
| `O` | Open all unread articles in browser and mark all as read |
| `x` | Scrape full article content from the web (for truncated articles) |
| `S` | Share article (opens command line with share targets) |
| `e` | Open (default) enclosure |
| `E` | Open enclosure (opens command line with enclosure type) |

---

## Read/Unread Status

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `r` | Mark current article as read (and go to next unread article) |
| `R` | Mark **all** articles as read (asks for confirmation) |
| `u` | Mark current article as unread |
| `U` | Mark **all** articles as unread (asks for confirmation) |
| `Alt-r` | Open command line to set read with query (e.g., `:read unread today`) |

**Note**: These commands are context-dependent! In the article list, they act on the *current article* or *all articles* in the list. On the feed list/tree they act on the *current category/feed* or *all categories/feeds*.

**Note**: To mark all articles *above* (and inlucding) the current article as read, press `0 r`; for all articles after `$ r`. This also works for `u`.

---
## Marking Articles

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `m` | Mark current article |
| `M` | Mark **all** articles (asks for confirmation) |
| `v` | Unmark current article |
| `V` | Unmark **all** articles (asks for confirmation) |

---
## Tags

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `t` | Open command line to tag article (e.g., `:tag tech`), **TAB** to autocomplete tag names |

You can create new tags with `:tagadd urgent red` (press **TAB** for autocomplete colors!). Once created, you can bulk-tag articles: `:tag tech unread` tags all unread articles as `tech`.

---

## Flagging Articles

You can flag (select) articles to execute bulk-operations like read, unread, mark, tag, etc. on them.


| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `f` | Flag article |
| `F` | Flag **all** articles |
| `d` | Unflag current article (*d*elete flag) |
| `D` | Unflag **all** articles  |
| `i` | Invert flag of current article (*d*elete flag) |
| `I` | Invert flag **all** articles  |
| `Alt-f`/`Alt-d`/`Alt-d` | Open command line with `flag`/`unflag`/`flaginvert` with query (e.g., `:flag unread today`) |


**Note**: These commands only work for article list!

After flagging article, you can bulk-execute any of the above commands on them (`r` for `read`, `m` for `mark`, `t` for `tag`, you get it).

**Note**: To flag flag of all articles *above* and including the current article, press `0 f`; for all articles after `$ f` etc. This also works for `d` and `i`.

---

## Zen Mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `z` | Toggle distraction-free mode (hides all panels except article content) |

---

## Article Views

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `1` | Show all articles |
| `2` | Show only unread articles |
| `3` | Show only marked articles |

---

## Searching & Filtering

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|

| `n` / `N` | Jump to next / previous match |
| `=` | Open command line to filter articles |
| `+ +` | Apply current filter |
| `+ r` | Clear filter and show all articles |

See [Article Queries](queries.md) for how to craft powerful queries.

**Note**: `=` executes `filter` which is *non-sticky*, i.e., when you change the any in the feed tree, it is not applied automatically. If you want to apply a *stick* filter, you have to use `filtersticky`, i.e., re-map `=` to `cmd filtersticky`.

---

## Sorting Articles

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `\` | Open command line to set sort order |
| `\| \|` | Reverse current sort order |
| `\| r` | Clear sort order and restore default |

Articles can be sorted by multiple criteria: `feed`, `date`, `synced`, `title`, or `author`. The sort order is displayed in the article list header with an icon (󰌼 for normal, 󰒿 for reversed).

**Examples:**
```
:sort date                    # Sort by date (newest first)
:sort >date                   # Sort by date (oldest first)
:sort feed title              # Sort by feed name, then by title
:sort feed date               # Sort by feed (A-Z), then by date (newest first)
```

For complete sorting documentation, see [Commands](commands.md#sorting-articles).

## Customizing Key Bindings

All key bindings can be customized in your configuration file. See the [Input Configuration](configuration.md#input-configuration) section for details on:

- How to remap existing keys
- How to create multi-key sequences (like `gg`)
- How to bind multiple commands to a single key
- How to unbind keys

**Example custom bindings:**
```toml
[input_config.mappings]
# Vim-style save and quit
"Z Z" = ["confirm quit"]

# Quick tagging
"t i" = ["tag important"]
"t u" = ["tag urgent"]

# Custom navigation
"C-j" = ["pagedown"]
"C-k" = ["pageup"]

# Using modifiers
"C-k" = ["..."] # Ctrl
"M-k" = ["..."] # Meta (Alt)
"S-f1" = ["..."] # Shift and F1
"S-down" = ["..."] # Shift and down arrow key
```

See the [default configuration](../examples/default-config.toml) for the complete list of default key bindings.
