## Article Queries

**dispatch** features a flexible query language that can be used across multiple contexts throughout the application. Queries are useful to display specific articles or execute bulk-operations.

## Quick Examples

Here are some examples to get you started:

```
tag paywall title:/heise\+/ feed:heise   # tags all articles from heise with titles containing "heise+" with tag paywall
read #paywall                         # marks all articles with the tag #paywall as read
filter newer:"1 hour ago" unread          # show only unread articles which are newer than one hour
read unread feed:pitchfork summary:rap    # marks all unread articles from pitchfork which contain rap (case-insensitive) as read
```

Query elements are **conjunctive** (AND-ed together), i.e., all specified conditions must be met for an article to match. To create more complex filters, use negation (`~`) or regular expressions with OR operators in case of search terms.

## Search Term Types

- **Word**: Case-insensitive word match: `title:rust`
- **Quoted String**: Exact phrase match: `title:"Rust programming"`
- **Regular Expression**: Regex pattern match (see [regex syntax documentation](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax)): `title:/^rust.*guide$/`

## Advanced Features

- **Negation**: Use `~` to negate any query (e.g., `~read` matches unread articles, `~title:politics` excludes articles with "politics" in title)
- **Multiple Criteria**: Combine multiple queries with spaces: all conditions must be satisfied (AND logic)
- **Relative Time**: Use natural language for time-based queries: `"1 week ago"`, `"yesterday"`, `"3 days ago"` (see [`parse_datetime` documentation](https://lib.rs/crates/parse_datetime) for more information)
- **Regular Expression OR**: Use the `|` operator in regex patterns for OR logic: `title:/(rust|python|javascript)/` matches articles with any of these languages in the title

## Example Queries

```
unread today                                    # Unread articles from today
feed:bbc unread                                 # Unread articles from BBC feed
category:"IT-News" marked                       # marked articles in feeds belonging to the category "IT-News"
title:/(?i)breaking|urgent/ newer:"1 hour ago"  # Recent breaking or urgent news (regex OR)
marked #important                               # Marked articles tagged as important
all:"climate change" newer:"1 week ago"         # Climate change articles from last week
~#politics unread                               # Unread articles without politics tag
author:/(?i)smith|jones|brown/                  # Articles by Smith, Jones, or Brown (regex OR)
title:/(feature|bug|fix)/ feed:/github|gitlab/  # Development-related articles from code hosting platforms
lastsync unread                                 # All unread articles from the last sync
tag flagged #readlater                          # Tag all flagged articles with `#readlater` (note: `tag #readlater` would also work)
```


### Using Sort Orders in Queries

Sort orders can be embedded in queries using the `sort` key. This is particularly useful in feed list queries. Check [Commands](commands.md#sorting-articles) for how sort orders are defined.

**Syntax:**
```
sort:"<sort order>"
```

**Note** the double quotes!

**Examples:**
```
unread sort:"date"                                     # Unread articles, newest first
feed:bbc sort:"feed title"                             # BBC articles sorted by feed then title
today sort:"synced"                                    # Today's articles, most recently synced first
#important unread sort:"<date"                         # Important unread, oldest first
newer:"1 week" sort:"feed date"                        # Last week's articles by feed, newest first
```

### Feed List Query Examples with Sorting

In your `feed_list` configuration, you can add sort orders to queries:

```toml
feed_list = [
  'query: "Latest Unread" unread sort:"date"',
  'query: "By Feed" unread sort:"feed date"',
  'query: "Recently Synced" sort:"synced"',
  "feeds",
  "tags",
]
```

## Query Examples

```
# Morning news: unread articles from the last 12 hours
newer:"12 hours ago" unread

# Today's important updates
today unread #important

# Catch up on specific feeds
feed:/tech|news/ unread today

# Quick scan: just headlines from trusted sources
feed:/(bbc|reuters|ap)/ unread newer:"6 hours ago"

# Follow a developing story
all:"climate summit" newer:"1 week ago"

# Compare coverage across sources
title:election newer:"3 days ago"

# Track multiple related topics (case-insensitive)
title:/(?i)(AI|machine learning|neural network)/

# Find related content by same author
author:smith unread
```

## Bulk Operations

Queries can be used for bulk operations (article list must be focused):

```
# Mark old articles as read
:read older:"2 months ago" unread

# Mark all articles in a category as read
:read category:"IT-News"

# Tag articles from specific feeds
:tag tech feed:/(github|gitlab|stackoverflow)/

# Remove tag from read articles
:untag toread read

# Mark urgent items (case-insensitive)
:mark title:/(?i)breaking|urgent/ newer:"1 hour ago"
```

## Tips & Tricks

**Combining Queries with Commands:**
- Use queries with any command that accepts a scope
- Examples: `:read <query>`, `:mark <query>`, `:tag <name> <query>`

**Testing Queries:**
- Use `:filter <query>` to preview results before bulk operations

**Saving Frequent Queries:**
- Add them to your feed list in the configuration file
- Create keybindings for common query-based commands
