*dispatch* is a *TUI RSS reader* based on the awesome [news-flash](https://gitlab.com/news-flash/news_flash) library.  
- *fast* in every aspect: non-blocking terminal user interface, (neo)vim-inspired keybindings, instant start-up and no clutter
- *stands* on the shoulder of *giants*: based on the news-flash library, *dispatch* supports many RSS providers, is efficient and reliable
- *powerful* and yet *easy to use out-of-the-box*: sane defaults which work for most, and yet configurable to meet anyone's requirements, from keybindings to colors, from displayed content to RSS provider
- read news like a pro: filter and search news with an easy-to-learn powerful *query language*, activate *zen mode* to focus on the article content and nothing else

*dispatch* is German for *breaking news*

# Quick Reference

Here are some key bindings to get you started.

| Key             | Action                                                        |
| -----           | --------                                                      |
| `?`             | Show all key bindings (search with `/`!)                      |
| `s`             | Sync all feeds                                                |
| `j` / `k`       | Move down / up                                                |
| `h` / `l`       | Move between panels (left/right)                              |
| `o`             | Open article in browser, mark as read, jump to next unread    |
| `r` / `u`       | Mark as read / unread                                         |
| `m` / `v`       | Mark (star) / unmark article                                  |
| `/`             | Search articles                                               |
| `:`             | Open command line                                             |
| `q`             | Quit                                                          |

**Tip:** Press `?` anytime to see all available commands, and use `/` in the help dialog to search!

**Another Tip**: Navigate to the article list and use `C-j`/`C-k` to move down/up in the feed list and use `M-k`/`M-j` to scroll the article content down/up. Of course, you can remap all keys to your liking.

# FAQ

### Which providers are supported?

See [news_flash_gtk for all supported providers](https://gitlab.com/news-flash/news_flash_gtk). 

### Does dispatch support smart folders?

Yes! Use queries in your feed list configuration. Example:

```toml
feed_list = [
  'query: "Important Today" #important unread today',
  'query: "Read Later" #readlater unread',
  "feeds",
]
```

### Can I customize keybindings and colors?

Absolutely! Everything is customizable via the [configuration file](docs/configuration.md). See `examples/default-config.toml` for all options.

### How do I save articles for later?

Create a tag (`:tagadd readlater red`), bind it to a key, and create a query in your feed list. See the [FAQ](docs/faq.md#how-can-i-save-articles-for-reading-later) for details.

### Can I hide feeds/categories/tags without unread/marked articles?

Yes, focus the feed list and press `2` / `3` to show only feeds/categories/tags with unread / marked articles, show all with `1`. Change the value of the configuration option `feed_list_scope` to either `all`, `unread` or `marked` to set the default value.


### Can I execute automatic operations after synchronisation/refresh?

Yes, via the option `after_sync_commands` [configuration](docs/configuration.md#after-sync_commands) for some recipes.

### Can I select articles and then mark them as read/unread/tag them etc.?

Yes, you can *flag* them by pressing `f` and then press `r` to mark all flagged articles as read. Similarly for `u`(unread), `m` (mark), `t` (tag), etc. Press `D` to remove all flags.

# Credits

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

*dispatch* was inspired by other awesome programs and libraries:

- [news-flash](https://gitlab.com/news-flash/news_flash) library and [news-flash GTK](https://gitlab.com/news-flash/news_flash_gtk), a modern Gnome/GTK RSS reader, both implemented in rust
- [newsboat](https://newsboat.org/) which has been my TUI RSS reader of choice for many years
- [spotify-player](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player), a TUI spotify music player written in rust. In particular, the theming system and how input is handled has been a great inspiration for *dispatch*
- [vifm](https://vifm.info/), [neomutt](https://neomutt.org/) with [notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org/) inspired the filtering and article query systems
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [vim](https://www.vim.org/) for their philosophy on user input
- [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) and all its supporting libraries for creating the TUI

## On the use of LLMs in this Project

This project was built as an experiment in learning Rust through LLM use. LLMs were used as tutors (asking questions, not providing solutions) and for documentation, but every line of code was intentionally written to solve a problem I understood.

📖 Read more about the LLM development approach in [LLM Development](docs/llm-development.md).
